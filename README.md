Customizable Boot Camper Box

A customisable boot camperbox, tested and successfully used during two driving vacations to the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The model can be size-adjusted and toggled between folded and unfolded.

Designed for the Ford Tourneo Connect 2014, with the rear seats folded down (not rocked forward in the footwell) and the front seats pushed all the way forward. The design can be customized using OpenSCAD or the Thingiverse Customizer to fit similar vehicles. 

The legs are attached using two L-angle aluminium bar secured with pop rivets. This has proven to be very durable. Standard piano hinges were attached to the edges of the moving surfaces to allow folding.

To fold out, the rear seats are locked forward with the first unfolded surface laid over them.  A towing strap modified with loops at either-end is fitted as a bridge between the chassis catch bolts on each of the sliding doors. This is used as support for the second unfolded surface. Both doors still securely lock whilst the strap is attached.

The wood used was sourced from B&Q (a UK hardware retailer) and cut at the store using the free wood cutting service. The model can be toggled to show the primitive objects that make the model. In this mode, the parts are also visually mapped against a typical 25mm x 1220mm x 2450mm plywood board. This is provided as an easy reference for the in-store saw operator.  The number of cuts fits inside the maximum number of cuts the store staff permit customers to have (although this varies from store to store).
